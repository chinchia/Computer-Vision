## Problem A. Line Fitting

### Implementation
1. Find the curve that fits the data using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a deep learning framework.
2. Plot a 3D figure that visualizes the loss function (of whole dataset) against parameters space.

## Problem B. License Plate Localization

### Implementation
1. Localize the 4 corners of the license plate.
2. The metric is the root mean-square error (RMSE) between the predicted locations and the ground-truth locations.
3. RMSE <= 15.0
